## Full Description

```
> EXECPROMPT v1.0 [READY]
> INITIALIZING TERMINAL INTERFACE...
> CONNECTION ESTABLISHED

ExecPrompt is a premium Ollama client built for users who demand more from their AI interface. Wrapped in a distinctive CyberTerm aesthetic — phosphor green on black, monospace type, zero fluff — it delivers the most capable mobile and desktop Ollama experience available.

▸ CORE CAPABILITIES

• Stream responses in real-time with full thinking model support (DeepSeek-R1, Qwen3, and more)
• Connect to local Ollama instances or Ollama Cloud — your infrastructure, your rules
• Web search integration — ground AI responses with live internet data via Ollama Cloud or Tavily
• Manage conversations with full history, search, export, and import
• Fine-tune model parameters on the fly — temperature, top-k, top-p, context window
• Attach images for multimodal conversations with vision-capable models
• Pull, delete, and manage Ollama models directly from the app

▸ DESIGNED FOR POWER USERS

• Five cyberpunk-themed color palettes: Classic Green, Amber, White, Neon Cyan, Synthwave
• JetBrains Mono typography throughout — because monospace is the only space
• Responsive layout adapts from phone to tablet to desktop with proper multi-pane views
• System prompt customization per conversation
• Markdown rendering with syntax-highlighted code blocks
• Copy, share, and export individual messages or entire conversations

▸ PRIVACY FIRST

• No telemetry. No analytics. No data collection.
• All conversations stored locally on your device
• API keys stored in secure device storage
• Connect to your own Ollama server — your models, your hardware, your data
• Open source: https://github.com/zervin/dayofgeek

▸ CONNECTIVITY

• Auto-discovers local Ollama instances
• Supports remote Ollama servers via custom URL
• Ollama Cloud integration for cloud-hosted models
• Works over WiFi, cellular, or tailnet — wherever your server lives

▸ BUILT BY DAYOFGEEK

ExecPrompt is built by DayOfGeek — independent software for people who think in terminals. No venture capital. No growth metrics. Just good tools for technical people.
